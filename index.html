  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p> Hi, I am Melissa. </p>

    <p> I am currently studying design at Massey University with a major in visual communcation design.
      I love to be creative when I get the chance, my favourite things to create and design are posters.
      I also love taking photos and videos in my spare time. </p>

  <p>  Summer is my favourite time of the year as thats when I usually am able to pull out my camera and go pro in order to get some footage.
      I love spending time with my friends, going on adventures and seeing my family.
    I prefer to be outdoors exploring new places or searching for views but I also like to be at home watching a good tv series with a bowl of ice cream. </p>

<p>  At home I have three crazy brothers, a dog called Charlie and my Mum and Dad we love to spend time together watching the rugby, going out kayaking, going on bush walks, eating and playing board games.
  Sometimes I get my home mixed up with the zoo as it can get wild at times but that's all part of the fun.
  </p>

  <p> I want to travel the world and it has been a dream of mine since I was young. My dream destination would have to be Bora Bora or Hawaii or anywhere tropical!
  I also want to travel around Europe and visit everywhere possible. </p>
